✓ Small spread indicates consistent prediction accuracy

## 🚀 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Load and Make Predictions

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load model and preprocessing artifacts
model = joblib.load('xgboost_forecasting_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('feature_scaler.pkl')
encoders = joblib.load('label_encoders.pkl')

# Prepare new data with same features (38 total)
# Apply feature engineering: temporal features, cyclical encoding, etc.
# Encode categorical variables using encoders
# Scale features using scaler

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
```

### Integration Points

1. **Real-time forecasting**: Use for predicting hourly/daily demand
2. **Capacity planning**: Identify peak demand periods
3. **Resource allocation**: Optimize charging pile distribution
4. **Alerting**: Set thresholds for resource constraints
5. **Financial forecasting**: Estimate revenue based on predicted usage

## 📈 NEXT STEPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Model Monitoring**
   - Track actual vs predicted performance in production
   - Retrain if prediction errors exceed 5% MAPE

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add external features (events, holidays, weather forecasts)
   - Consider geospatial clustering
   - Include competitor station information

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Run GridSearch/RandomSearch for optimal parameters
   - Consider Bayesian optimization for large hyperparameter spaces

4. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Combine XGBoost with LightGBM or CatBoost
   - Use stacking for improved robustness

5. **Cross-validation**
